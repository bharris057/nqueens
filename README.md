# nqueens
A general solution to the Eight Queens Problem, implemented in JavaScript.

This project began as a homework assignment for my collegiate C++ course. The algorithm was given to us in psuedocode so I can't claim credit for designing it. I reimplemented it in JavaScript a few years after.

Back in 2012, calculating the solution with 22 queens would consistently cause the browser to timeout. In 2021, the calculation takes about 1 second.
